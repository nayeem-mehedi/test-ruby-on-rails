## Project Overview
This is simple CRUD api about articles.
I have also added one endpoint where I called an external api and prepared the response based on that. 

## Technologies Used
- ruby-on-rails
- httparty
- sqlite3
- puma

## Project Setup

Install all gems:
```bash
bundle install
```

Update the database with new data model:
```bash
rake db:migrate
```

Start the web server on http://localhost:3000 by default:
```bash
rails server
```
